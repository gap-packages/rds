The <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> package is meant to help with complete searches for
relative difference sets in non-abelian groups. Of course, it also
works for abelian groups, but no special features are implemented for
this case. In particular, there is no support for multipliers.
<p>
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> has no undocumented functions. While this is generally regarded
as a feature, it leads to a quite long manual and a lot of
documentation not needed for everyday work. To make reading easier,
all but the basic chapters contain a small introductory paragraph
pointing out which functions may be interesting for the user and which
are merely helper functions called by other functions.
<p>
The structure of this manual is a follows: First, there is a chapter
about brute force methods which are easy to use but are not suitable
for very difficult calculations.
<p>
Then, chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP003.htm">RDS:A basic example</a> shows the use of the more advanced
methods in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> and explains the basic idea of a complete
search for difference sets with this package. After reading this
chapter, you should be able to use <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> even for large
examples. 
<p>
The following chapters <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP004.htm">RDS:General concepts</a> and <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP005.htm">RDS:Invariants for Difference Sets</a> contain the documentation of the functions used in a
search for difference sets. They explain the concepts and low level
functions which provide a lot of control over the searching process. If
you are searching for difference sets in several groups of the same
order, you may find this helpful.
<p>
The next chapter shows an example of calculating a relative
difference set using low level functions.
<p>
Chapter <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP007.htm">RDS:Ordered Signatures</a> introduces another invariant for
difference sets. The functions for calculating this invariant do only
work effectively in a few cases, so this part of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> is a
little bit experimental. However, the invariant is very powerful, so
this chapter is kept.
<p>
In <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP008.htm">RDS:Block Designs and Projective Planes</a>, the methods for
generating a BlockDesign in the sense of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">DESIGN</font> <a href="biblio.htm#DESIGN"><cite>DESIGN</cite></a> from a
difference set are described. A few functions for analyzing projective
planes are given as well.
<p>
The final chapter describes a few functions which are not related to
difference sets and may be useful in other situations.
<p>

<h2><a name="SECT001">1.1 Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<p><p>
I would like to thank U.&nbsp;Dempwolff for supervising the thesis out of
which <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> grew, and L.&nbsp;Soicher for many suggestions which
greatly improved the usability of this package.
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT002">1.2 Installation</a></h2>
<p><p>
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> depends on Leonard Soicher's <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">DESIGN</font> <a href="biblio.htm#DESIGN"><cite>DESIGN</cite></a> package
which, in turn, depends on <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GRAPE</font> <a href="biblio.htm#GRAPE"><cite>GRAPE</cite></a>. You need to install these
packages before you can run <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font>.
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li> Download the package archive rds <i>ver</i> . <i>ext</i>
   where <i>ver</i> is some version number and <i>ext</i> is an extension like tar.bz2,
   tar.gz, -win.zip or zoo.
<p>
<li> Copy the archive to the directory where the other packages live.
   This is either the directory <code>pkg</code> in the GAP root path or a local directory in your home 
   directory (on most unix-like systems, this will probably be <code>~/gap/pkg/</code>).
<p>
<li> change directory to your package directory and unpack the
archive by using the right one of the following commands:
  <dl compact>
<dt><dd>
                    tar -xjf rds<var>ver</var>.tar.bz2
  <dt><dd>tar -xzf rds<var>ver</var>.tar.gz
  <dt><dd>zoo -extract rds<var>ver</var>.zoo 
  <dt><dd>unzip rds<var>ver</var>-win.zip 
<p>
(replace <i>ver</i> with the version number)
<p>

</ol>
<li>
  start GAP. If you have unpacked the archive to 'gap/pkg' in your
  home directory, you might have to use ''gap -l '<i>homedir</i>/gap;' ''
  where <i>homedir</i> is the path of your home directory (use 'pwd' to
  find out what it is, if you don't know it)
<p>
<li> Type <code>LoadPackage("rds");</code> to load <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font>
<p>
</ol>
For a test, see the examples in chapters <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP002.htm">RDS:AllDiffsets and OneDiffset</a> and <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP003.htm">RDS:A basic example</a>.
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT003">1.3 Verbosity</a></h2>
<p><p>
There are two info classes that control the about of additional
information <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> prints:
<p>
<a name = "SSEC003.1"></a>
<li><code>InfoRDS V</code>
<p>
Some methods of the RDS package print additional information if <code>InfoRDS</code>
is set to a level of 1 or higher. At level 0, no information is output. 
The default value is 1.
<p>
<a name = "SSEC003.2"></a>
<li><code>DebugRDS V</code>
<p>
Some methods of the RDS package print additional information if <code>DebugRDS</code>
is set to a level of 1 or higher. At level 0, no information is output. 
The default level is 0. Expect a lot of output at level 2.
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT004">1.4 Definitions and Objects</a></h2>
<p><p>
This section lists the definition of ordinary and relative difference
sets as well as the concept of partial difference sets and their
development.  This will be repeated in <a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP004.htm#SECT001">RDS:Introduction</a> where a
notion of equivalence is introduced and the implementation in
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> is discussed.
<p>
Let <i>G</i> be a finite group and <i>N</i> &#8838; <i>G</i>. The set <i>R</i> &#8838; <i>G</i>
with &#124;<i>R</i>&#124;=<i>k</i> is called a ``relative difference set of order
<i>k</i>&#8722;&#955; relative to the forbidden set <i>N</i>'' if the following
properties hold:
<p>
<ol>
<li> The multiset { <i>a</i>&#183;<i>b</i><sup>&#8722;1</sup>:<i>a</i>,<i>b</i> &#8712; <i>R</i>} contains
  every nontrivial ( &#8800; 1) element of <i>G</i>&#8722;<i>N</i> exactly &#955;
  times.  
<li> { <i>a</i>&#183;<i>b</i><sup>&#8722;1</sup>:<i>a</i>,<i>b</i> &#8712; <i>R</i>} does not contain
  any non-trivial element of <i>N</i>.
</ol>
<p>
Let <i>D</i> &#8838; <i>G</i> be a difference set, then the incidence structure
with points <i>G</i> and blocks {<i>Dg</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>g</i> &#8712; <i>G</i>} is called the
<strong>development</strong> of <i>D</i>. In short:  <span class="roman">dev</span> <i>D</i>. Obviously, <i>G</i> acts on
<span class="roman">dev</span><i>D</i> by multiplication from the right.
<p>
Relative difference sets with <i>N</i>=1 are called (ordinary) difference
sets. The development of a difference set with <i>N</i>=1 and &#955; = 1
is projective plane of order <i>k</i>&#8722;1.
<p>
In group ring notation a relative difference set satisfies
<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td><table align="center" cellspacing="0"  cellpadding="2"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center"> <i>RR</i><sup>&#8722;1</sup>=<i>k</i>+&#955;(<i>G</i>&#8722;<i>N</i>)&#183;</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
<p>
The set <i>D</i> &#8838; <i>G</i> is called <strong>partial relative difference set</strong>
with forbidden set <i>N</i>, if
<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td><table align="center" cellspacing="0"  cellpadding="2"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center"> <i>DD</i><sup>&#8722;1</sup>=&#954;+</td><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center"><small></small><!--sup--><br /><span class="largerstill">&#8721;<br /></span><small><i>g</i> &#8712; <i>G</i>&#8722;<i>N</i></small>&nbsp;<br /></td><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center"><i>v</i><sub><i>g</i></sub><i>g</i> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table> 
<p>
holds for some 1 &#8804; &#954; &#8804; <i>k</i> and 0 &#8804; <i>v</i><sub><i>g</i></sub>  &#8804; &#955; for
all <i>g</i> &#8712; <i>G</i>&#8722;<i>N</i>.  If <i>D</i> is a relative difference set then ,obviously,
<i>D</i> is also a partial relative difference set.
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>
<p>
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font> implicitly assumes that the <strong>every</strong> partial difference
set contains the identity element (see the notion of equivalence in
<a href="../../rds/htm/CHAP004.htm#SECT001">RDS:Introduction</a> for the mathematical reason). However, the identity
<strong>must not</strong> be contained in the lists representing partial relative
difference sets.
<p>
So in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">RDS</font>, the difference set <code>[ (), (1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
(1,4,7,3,6,2,5) ]</code> is represented by the list <code>[ (1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
(1,4,7,3,6,2,5) ]</code>. And no set of three non-trivial permutations will
be accepted as an ordinary difference set of <code>Group((1,2,3,4,5,6,7))</code>.
<p>
For this reason the lists returned by functions like <a href="CHAP004.htm#SSEC004.1">AllDiffsets</a> do
only contain non-trivial elements and look too short.
