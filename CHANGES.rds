1.9:
- renamed `PRank@RDS` to `RDS_PRank`
- renamed `FOO` to `BAR`
- various janitorial changes

------------------

1.8:
- Avoid incorrect pluralizations in output
- various janitorial changes

------------------

1.7:
- move package to GitHub
- various janitorial changes

------------------

1.6:

------------------

1.5:
 - path fixed in PackageInfo.g
 
------------------

1.4:
- directory for PackageInfo.g and archives changed

------------------

1.3:
- required GAP version set to 4.5 due to the use of the "namespaces" feature
- pRank and maxAutsizeForOrbitCalculation renamed to PRrank@RDS and 
  MaxAutsizeForOrbitCalculation@RDS to conform with GAP's naming convention for packages.
- additional sorting of records introduced in ReducedDiffsets.gi (made necessary by the new ordering method for records in gap 4.5)

------------------

1.2:
- homepage moved.

------------------

1.1:
- minor fixes in the ShallowCopy part of ConcatenationOfIterators and 
   CartesianIterator
- ReducedStartsets rewritten.
- package moved from Galway  back to Kaiserslautern

------------------

1.0:
- changed years in the copyright notice (from 2006 to 2006-2008).
------------------

0.9beta28:
- marginal improvement in speed in the brute force methods for <lambda>=1
- slight change in ReducedStartsets (probably better performance in large cases)
- in RemainingCompletions[NoSort]: replaced "Intersection(diffset,forbidden)<>[]"
     with "ForAny(diffest,i->i in forbidden)".
- OneDiffset and AllDiffsets do now check if the given partial difference set really is 
      a partial difference set. If it isn't, the empty set is returned.
- Replaced all "Sqrt" calls with "RootInt" calls in AllDiffsets and OneDiffset.
     This greatly reduces the method-selection overhead.
- DevelopmentOfRDS is more flexible now. I.e. it takes all sensible kinds of input.
- fixed the "blockSizes" bug in DevelopmentOfRDS (thanks to Leonard Soicher)
- the file rds.tex vanished from the doc/ directory. The text has been inserted in 
      .msk file and  does now also appear in the .html and online documentation.
- method names in text paragraphs are now surrounded by double quotes.
      This generates links in the html documentation.
- Consequently, references in the .pdf documentation are also not given by numbers 
       anymore. This doesn't look too go0d for sections and chapters, but refering to a 
       function as 4.1.2 doesn't make much sense...
       For this, the definition of \printref has been changed in the file gapmacro.tex
- some more changes in the manual (thanks to Leonard Soicher)
- Set state to "accepted" 

------------------

0.9beta27:
- Fixed a few errors in the documentation
- cleaned up directories
- fixed permissions for htm directory.
- fixed a bug in `AllDiffsets' and `OneDiffset'

------------------

0.9beta26:
- Added AllDiffsetsNoSort
- Added OneDiffset and OneDiffsetNoSort
- Added IsDiffset
- More changes to the documentation. Chapter about AllDiffsets and OneDiffset
  added.

------------------

0.9beta25:
- Introduced function DevelopmentOfRDS
- Changed all functions for projective planes to new data structures.
- Projective planes are now BlockDesigns as in DESIGN
- RDS does now depend on DESIGN
- AllDiffsets can now be called in *many* new and simple ways. 

- Rewrote documentation and added many examples.
------------------


0.9beta22:
Important changes:
- fixed a bug in OrderedSignatureOfSet (this could lead to crashes and
  wrong results)

Minor changes:
- changed date format in library files to yyyy/mm/dd
- removed NormalSubgroupsForRep taking a group as first argument (this
  function was undocumented incompatible with the rest of the
  functions anyway).
------------------

0.9beta21:
- started changelog (this file)
- added license notice to README.rds
- archive extraction commands given in README.rds
changes proposed by B. Assmann (thank you):
- corrected PackageInfo.g 	
- moved source files to lib/ directory
- set package state to "deposited"
